# BMI_and_Full_Years
## Show 👌BMI and 👉Full years of person → all in one program❗
This program was created for my 💍wife. She is 👩‍⚕️Dr. Medizin and often she needs a fast way to calculate the BMI and full years of the person (yes some people, do not remember how old they are🧙🏼‍♂️). This is why I created a program that can calculate both.

✅Requirements:

- Python 3.8 +
- PyQt6

💡or 

just use the BMI_and_Full_Years_Setup installer and install the program on your computer. To execute click the icon on your 👉screen or 👉BMI_and_Full_Years.exe.
